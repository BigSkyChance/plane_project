# plane_project
C++ Final Semester project

In this project you are the ticketer at a ticket counter
Apparently at the smallest airport in america and with the most patient customers
You set up the size of the planes you are dealing with
When a customer arrives and their party can fit on the plane, they go on
If they can't fit on the plane they go sit in the lounge untill that plane can fit them
